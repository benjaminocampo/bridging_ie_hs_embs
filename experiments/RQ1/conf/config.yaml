  experiment_description: "**RQ1:** If we have two different datasets, D1 and
  D2, and two model instances M1 and M2, with the same architecture (BERT,
  HateBERT, etc.) trained on train_D1, and train_D2 respectively. Are the
  embeddings of test_D1 and test_D2 comparable? What about the HS classes? what
  happens with explicit HS? and implicit HS?."
